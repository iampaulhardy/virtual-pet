# Virtual Pet

This repository is for my Virtual Pet Exercise:

1. Pet can be given a name.
2. Pet can get older.
3. As pet gets older, it gets hungrier and less fit.
4. Pet can walk to increase fitness.
5. Pet can eat to decrease hunger.
6. Pet can be spoken to to see if it needs feeding or walking.
7. Pet will die if it gets too hungry or unfit.
8. Pet will die after 30 days
